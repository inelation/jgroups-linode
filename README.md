JGroups Discovery implementation for Linode (http://linode.com)

Use this implementation to overcome Linode multicasting limitations.  This simple project uses the Linode API implementation by theo: https://github.com/theo/linode-api

Only nodes with private IP addresses are returned by this discovery implementation.  At the moment Linode does not support tagging or grouping of nodes.
